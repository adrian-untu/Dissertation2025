## Generate the Moral Machine scenarios and collect LLMs' responses.

For GPT-3.5,

```
python run_chatgpt.py --nb_scenarios 50000
```

For GPT-4,

```
python run_chatgpt.py --model gpt-4-0613 --nb_scenarios 10000
```

For PaLM 2,

```
python run_palm2.py --nb_scenarios 50000
```

For Llama 2,

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 run_llama2.py --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b-chat/
```

The scripts `run_chatgpt.py`, `run_palm2.py`, and `run_llama2.py` rely on both `generate_moral_machine_scenarios.py`, which houses the function for generating Moral Machine scenarios, and `config.py`, which provides the configuration settings for `generate_moral_machine_scenarios.py`. All these files should be placed in the same directory for proper execution.

**NOTE:** The scenarios and responses, we generated and collected, are available in `./results/`.

## Data Analysis (Regenerating the Results)

### Data preprocessing

```
python convert_pickle_csv.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 --nb_scenarios 50000
```

To specify the model, use the following arguments:

* GPT-4: `--model gpt-4-0613`
* PaLM 2: `--model palm2`
* Llama 2: `--model llama-2-7b-chat`

The column names of the CSV files generated after running `convert_pickle_csv.py` are the same as those in [the previous study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6) (see also the "File 2: SharedResponse.csv" section in [their supplemental text](https://osf.io/wt6mc?view_only=4bb49492edee4a8eb1758552a362a2cf)). For details on the column names, please refer the following descriptions:

Before explaining the columns, see an example of one scenario in the CSV files. Recall that each scenario is represented by two rows in the data, each row is one of the two outcomes (note the matching ResponseID). An interpretation of the scenario represented in these two lines is provided below.

This data set contains 41 columns. The last 20 columns represent the number of characters of each type in each outcome. For example, the columns "Man" and "Woman" represent the number of Man and Woman characters in each outcome (both are zero in this example). Note here that Man and Woman represent gendered (neutral-otherwise) adult characters. They are different from other gendered characters who has further descriptions like FemaleDoctor and LargeMan. In this dataset, the column Man provides the number of times the character Man exist in that outcome rather than the sum of all occurrences of male characters in that outcome.

With a quick look at this example you can see that one outcome (first row) contains a baby stroller, a female athlete, a female doctor, and a cat. The second outcome (second row) contains the same characters in addition to a male athlete. We have only one character of each type here, but each of these columns could take a value between 0 and 5, with the crucial restriction that the total number of characters in each outcome (row) is between 1 and 5. This number is captured in the column "NumberOfCharacters". The column "DiffNumberOFCharacters" captures the absolute difference in total number of characters between the two outcomes, which is 1 in this case.

Now, we visit the remaining 21 columns which are available in all three files:

['ResponseID', 'ExtendedSessionID', 'UserID', 'ScenarioOrder',
 'Intervention', 'PedPed', 'Barrier', 'CrossingSignal', 'AttributeLevel',
 'ScenarioTypeStrict', 'ScenarioType', 'DefaultChoice', 'NonDefaultChoice', 'DefaultChoiceIsOmission', 
'NumberOfCharacters', 'DiffNumberOFCharacters', 'Saved', 
'Template', 'DescriptionShown', 'LeftHand', 'UserCountry3']

- ResponseID: a unique, random set of characters that represents an identifier of the scenario. Since each scenario is represented by 2 rows, every row should share a 'ResponseID' with another row. For the purpose of analysis there was some filtering early on at the level of outcomes (see code files). As such, it is possible that some rows in the CSV files do not share a RespondID with any other row. If a scenario-level data set is desired (each row represents a scenario), this column can be used to reshape the data set by matching two rows of the same ResponseID.

- ExtendedSessionID: a unique, random set of characters that represents an identifier of the session. This ID combines a randomly generated ID for the session, concatenated with the UserID. 

- UserID: a unique, random set of characters that represents an identifier of the user (respondent), captured using browser fingerprints.

- ScenarioOrder: this takes a value between 1 and 13, representing the order in which the scenario was presented in the session.

- Intervention: represents the decision of the AV (STAY or SWERVE) that would lead to this outcome [0: the character would die if the AV stays, 1: the character would die if AV swerves]. This is not the actual decision taken by the user, but rather a part of the structural characterisation of the scenario.

- PedPed: every scenario has either pedestrians vs. pedestrians or pedestrians vs. passengers (or passengers vs. pedestrians). This column provides information about not just this outcome, but about the combination of both outcomes in the scenario; whether the scenario pits pedestrians against each other or not [1: pedestrians vs. pedestrians, 0: pedestrians vs. passengers (or vice versa)]

- Barrier: Another structural column which describes whether the potential casualties in this outcome are passengers or pedestrians [1: passengers, 0: pedestrians]. This column was used to calculate PedPed (after matching rows on RespondID).

- CrossingSignal: Another structural column which represents whether there is a traffic light in this outcome, and light colour if yes [0: no legality involved, 1: green or legally crossing, 2: red or illegally crossing]. Every scenario that has pedestrians vs. pedestrians (i.e. PedPed=1) features one of three legality-relevant characterisations: a) the pedestrians on both sides are crossing with no legal complications, b) one group is crossing legally (on a green light), while the other is crossing illegally (on a red light), and c) vice versa. Every scenario that has pedestrians vs. passengers (i.e. PedPed=0) features also one of three legality-relevant characterisations: a) the pedestrians are crossing with no legal complications, b) the pedestrians are crossing legally (on a green light), and c) pedestrians are crossing illegally (on a red light). There are no legality concerns for passengers.

- Saved: this resembles the actual decision made by the user [1: user decided to save the characters in this outcome, 0: user decided to kill the characters in this outcome]. Note that this column is reverse coded from the database. On the website, users click on the outcome they choose. That means the choice they make results in the death of the characters represented in that outcome (with a skull sign on the website). You can imagine another column named "Killed" which would be the exact opposite of "Saved" (i.e. 1 if Saved is 0 and 0 if Saved is 1).

- NumberOfCharacters: takes a value between 1 and 5, the total number of characters in this outcome. This is the sum of numbers in the last 20 columns (character columns). It also represents the number of characters who will be saved or killed based on “Saved" value.

- DiffNumberOFCharacters: takes a value between 0 and 4; difference in number of characters between this outcome and the other outcome.

- Template: the scenario was answered using 'desktop', 'mobile', or 'tablet'.

- DescriptionShown: whether the user clicked “show description” to present the textual description of the scenario before choosing the outcome [1: description button was clicked at least once for this outcome, 0 description button was never clicked for this button].

- LeftHand: The order of the two outcomes (as a result of STAY vs. SWERVE decision) is randomised. This column captures the position of the outcome as presented to the users [1: this outcome appeared on the lefthand side of screen, 0: this outcome appeared on the righthand side of the screen].

- UserCountry3: the alpha-3 ISO code of the country from which the user accessed the website. This is generated from the user IP which is collected but not shared here.

- ScenarioType and ScenarioTypeStrict: These two columns have 7 values, corresponding to 7 types of scenarios (6 attributes + random). These are: "Utilitarian","Gender", "Fitness", "Age", "Social Value", "Species", and "Random".
In the early stage of the website, we forgot to include a code that gives the scenario type (one of the 6 categories mentioned above + random). We had to write a code to figure that out from the character types. This is the "ScenarioType" column. Some scenarios who were generated as part of the "random", could fit in one of the 6 other categories. Later, we used a clear parameter to capture this type, which is in "ScenarioTypeStrict". Thus, this column provides an accurate description, but it does not have a value for the early scenarios. In the analysis for the figures, whenever we filtered based on the scenario type, we used both columns. For example, to filter the age related scenarios, we use:
    ScenarioTypeStrict=“Age” &amp;&amp; ScenarioType=“Age” 
where "&amp;&amp;” is the logic AND.

- AttributeLevel: is dependent on the scenario type. Each scenario type (except random) has two levels: 
+Gender: [Males: characters are males, Females: characters are females]
+Age: [Young: characters in this outcome are younger (Boy/Girl + Man/Woman) than in the other outcome, Old: characters in this outcome are older (Elderly Man/Woman and Man/Woman)].
+Fitness: [Fit: characters in this outcome are more fit (Male/Female Athlete and Man/Woman), Fat: characters in this outcome are less fit (Large Man/Woman and Man/Woman)].
+Social Value: this was changed in the analysis to "social status" instead, and the characters Male/Female Doctor and Criminal were filtered out [High: characters in this outcome have higher social status (Male/Female Executives and Man/Woman), Low: characters have a lower social status (Homeless and Man/Woman)]
+Species: [Hoomans: characters in this outcome are humans (all but Dog/Cat), Pets: characters in this side are pets (Dog/Cat)]
+Utilitarian: [More: there are more characters in this outcome, Less: there are fewer people in this outcome]. In fact, the characters on the "More" side are the same characters on the "Less" side, in addition to at least one more characters. (excuse the error in using "Less" for a countable)
+ Random: it has one value ["Rand": characters in both outcomes are randomly generated].

- DefaultChoice', 'NonDefaultChoice':
Default Choice depends on the Scenario Type. This was chosen randomly (the word “default" here has no special meaning). For the following Scenario Types: ["Gender", "Fitness", "Age", "Social Status", “Species”, "Utilitarian"], the default choice is ["Male", "Fit", "Young", "High", “Hoomans”, “More"], while the non-default choice is ["Female", "Fat", "Old", "Low", “Pets”, ”Less"]. These two columns are only useful as an aid for the following column, "DefaultChoiceIsOmission".

- DefaultChoiceIsOmission: Omission here means no intervention (Intervention =0), and default choice is as described from "DefaultChoice" column. When DefaultChoiceIsOmission = 1 it means that based on the scenario type, characters that hold the default choice (that is, males for gender, fit for fitness, young for age,…etc.) will be the ones killed if the AV does nothing (omission or no intervention). On the other hand, if DefaultChoiceIsOmission = 0, then the characters that hold the non-default choice will be the ones killed if the AV does nothing (i.e., the characters holding the default choice will be the ones killed if the car swerves (i.e., intervenes)).

For example, suppose that the "ScenarioType" is "Gender". This means that "DefaultChoice" = "Males". When the column "DefaultChoiceIsOmission" is equal to 1 it means that Males will die on the omission decision (i.e. if the AV stays on its route), while Females will die on the commission (i.e. if the AV swerves). When "ScenarioType" = "Age", '"DefaultChoiceIsOmission"=1' means younger people will die on the omission, etc.

After explaining the columns, now we get back to the example scenario above. This scenario represents the dilemma in which there are 4 passengers in the AV, and 5 pedestrians who are crossing legally. There is a barrier in front of the AV. If the AV stays, it will hit the barrier and kill the 4 passengers, if it swerves it will kill the 5 pedestrians. The user chose for the AV to SWERVE and thus has decided to sacrifice the 5 pedestrians and spare the 4 passengers.
